# Tech-Roadmap

Tech-Roadmap is a cutting-edge web platform built to bridge the gap between social interaction and educational growth in the technology sector. Developed with React on the front end and backed by Tech-Roadmap-DRF, the Django REST Framework-based API, this project delivers a seamless user experience that caters to both tech enthusiasts and learners alike.

The primary goal of Tech-Roadmap is to create an interactive space where users can engage in two distinct ways. First, users can post short updates, thoughts, or tips on any tech-related topic—much like you would on Facebook—creating an ongoing exchange of ideas and insights within the community. This social aspect fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing among developers, learners, and tech professionals.

Second, Tech-Roadmap offers a course enrollment feature that mirrors platforms like Udemy. Users can browse through a wide variety of technology-focused courses, enroll in those that interest them, and further their skills in programming, development, and more. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn new tech skills or a seasoned professional sharing your expertise, Tech-Roadmap is designed to support both learning and collaboration.

By combining social interaction with education, the platform aims to empower users to explore new technologies, share their knowledge, and grow within the tech community. Whether you’re here to share, learn, or both, Tech-Roadmap provides a unique space to achieve your goals.

This Front End website makes use of the backend Django-Rest-Framework project which has the following repository [Tech-Roadmap-DRF](https://github.com/AlAliMazen/Tech-Roadmap-DRF) as a source code and the [Tech-Roadmap-DRF](https://tech-roadmap-drf-6a7361986bbb.herokuapp.com/) as deployed version.

### Images
🚀 **merit & beyhond**

Explain why you used certain icons and images on your site

### Design Elements
🚀 **merit & beyhond**

The design of Tech-Roadmap combines responsiveness, intuitive navigation, and visual elements that enhance user experience across both mobile and desktop platforms. Below are the key design elements used:

1. **Responsive Navigation**: The navigation bar is responsive across devices, adapting to both desktop and mobile views. It provides different options for logged-in users and visitors, ensuring personalized access based on the user’s status.

2. **Container Structure**: A structured container layout is used to hold both articles and courses, providing a clean and organized view. This design keeps content accessible and neatly categorized, improving usability.

3. **Card Elements**: Cards are used to display both article and course content. For articles, the card shows the title and body, while for courses, it reflects the course title and an "About" section, offering a clear and consistent format.

4. **Iconography**: Intuitive icons are used to represent key interactions:
   - **Person Plus/Minus Icons**: Indicate course enrollment and unenrollment actions.
   - **Stars**: Represent user ratings for courses and reviews.
   - **Comment Icon**: Used to show interaction with articles, enabling users to leave comments.
   - **Home Icon**: Directs users back to the homepage for easy navigation.
   - **Hearts**: Represent the like feature, adding a social aspect to article engagement.
   - **Sign-in/Log-out Icons**: Visually distinct icons for logging in and out provide a user-friendly interface for authentication actions.

5. **Accordion Elements**: An accordion component, provided by React Bootstrap, allows users to click on article or course titles to expand and display the full content. This collapsible design conserves space while offering dynamic content viewing options.

These elements together ensure a seamless and engaging user experience, making navigation, interaction, and content consumption intuitive and visually appealing.

### Animations and Transitions
🚀 **merit & beyhond**

Trnasiont and animation was extended from and applied when interacting with:
  - Clicking on action buttons like sign up / sign in / logout 
  - Hover effect applied all over the website including navbar item links and the active item in the menu bar

  - Overlay layout indicating that user can't for example comment on article when he is not logged in.

  - Overlay tipp when trying to enrol twice for the same course, reviewing the course twice or rating twice

  - Auto hide from the notifications 


### Frameworks
🚨**Required**

- Here is a table that explains the frameworks and functions used in developing tech-Roadmap front-end website:

| **Framework/Function** | **Explanation** |
|---|---|
| **React-Bootstrap** | React-Bootstrap is a front-end framework that integrates Bootstrap's responsive design elements into React components. It is used for styling and structuring the website with components like: <br> - **Accordion** for collapsible sections <br> - **Navbar** for responsive navigation <br> - **Cards** for displaying articles and courses <br> - **Container** for organizing layout <br> - **Buttons**, **Images**, **Forms**, and **InputGroup** for UI interactions <br> - **Alert** for displaying error or success messages <br> - **Rows** and **Columns** for responsive grid layouts |
| **Axios** | Axios is a promise-based HTTP client used for making API requests and handling responses. It is useful for: <br> - Fetching data from the backend <br> - Sending POST requests to create or update resources <br> - Handling errors and responses consistently across the application. |
| **React Hooks (useState, useHistory, pathname, useLocation, useMemo, useRef, useEffect)** | React Hooks are functions that let you use state and lifecycle features in functional components. Key functions include: <br> - **useState**: Manages the state of a component <br> - **useHistory**: Provides navigation functionality, allowing you to programmatically change the browser's URL <br> - **pathname** and **useLocation**: Track the current URL path, helping components react to navigation changes <br> - **useMemo**: Optimizes performance by memoizing expensive calculations <br> - **useRef**: Accesses and manipulates DOM elements or store persistent values between renders <br> - **useEffect**: Handles side effects like fetching data, subscriptions, or manually updating the DOM. |
|**React Quill** |Applied to display rich text formatting on the front end. Admins use this to input rich text content through the admin panel, which is then shown to users in a human-readable format. For implementation and how to use it you can visit the [official Quil Documentation](https://quilljs.com/docs/quickstart)|

These frameworks and functions work together to create a responsive, interactive, and performant front-end for the Tech-Roadmap website.

  perhaps lead assessors to the file of interest in your repo

### Custom Javascript
🚨**Required**

- call attention to any custom javascript you created to help your User Experience you can organize this by functions or
  files

## Wireframes
🚨**Required**

### Wireframes Overview

For developing the wireframes of Tech-Roadmap, I utilized [**Balsamiq**](https://balsamiq.com), a wireframing tool provided through a license from Code Institute. Balsamiq allowed me to create simple, clean, and intuitive layouts that closely resemble the structure used in the walkthrough project from Code Institute. The wireframes serve as a blueprint for how each page in the Tech-Roadmap is laid out.

Below are the wireframes for the following pages:

1. **Home (Article Pages)**: This page showcases the main articles, displaying their titles, summaries, and author details. The layout is clean and focused on readability.

![Home-page](./README_ASSETS/add_article.png)

2. **Courses Page**: This page lists the available courses, showing course titles, descriptions, and enrollment count. It highlights features like ratings and reviews count as well to engage visitors.

![courses-page](./README_ASSETS/Courses_A.png)

3. **Adding Category Page**: This page provides a form for adding new categories to the platform. The layout is simple, with input fields and submission buttons.

![add-category-page](./README_ASSETS/add_category.png)

4. **Adding Article Page**: This page allows logged-in users to write and submit new articles. The wireframe includes fields for title, content, and category selection and image.

![adding-article](./README_ASSETS/add_article.png)

5. **Commenting on Article Page**: This page enables users to leave comments on articles. The layout is straightforward, with a comment box and submit button for user interactions.

![add-comment](./README_ASSETS/article_comment.png)

6. **Add Review to a Course**: This page allows users to submit reviews and ratings for courses they have enrolled in. It includes input areas for rating scores and review text.

![Review-of-the-course](./README_ASSETS/Courses.png)

The wireframes were designed with simplicity in mind, prioritizing user interaction and ease of navigation. A soft copy of these wireframes can be found in the[ project’s GitHub repository](./README_ASSETS/Tech-roadmap.bmpr) for reference. They helped guide the development process and ensure the final implementation aligned with the planned user experience.


# Information Architecture

As part of the requirements for this project you need to have at **least 3 custom data models**.  It's still under discussion what that means, but I'd make 1 original and then update the products to be custom to what you are selling and create another new one. It's this section that discusses your data and how each piece relates to another and draws out the CRUD functionality you built. You must have CREATE, READ, UPDATE & DELETE for at least one model.

## Entity Relationship Diagram
🚨**Required**

Wade Williams wrote a great blog about how to add a django extension to auto create an ERD. https://wadewilliams.com/technology-software/generating-erd-for-django-applications/ You can always draw one out by hand or google sheets. You can also draw this up by hand if you want or use a spreadsheet to show your data model.

## Database Choice
🚀 **merit & beyhond**

I have used PostgreSQL indicated and recommended by Code Institute. First I have set up a database connection using the CI recommendations and link it int he Project env.py as DATABASE_URL. 

### Why PostgreSQL (Advantages)

Here are some key advantages of PostgreSQL, especially in **contrast to NoSQL Database systems**:

| Advantage                     | Explanation                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ACID Compliance**            | PostgreSQL is fully ACID-compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), which ensures reliable transactions and data integrity. NoSQL systems often prioritize flexibility over strict data consistency. |
| **Relational Database**        | PostgreSQL is a relational database, which means it uses structured schemas, tables, and relationships (e.g., primary and foreign keys). This makes it ideal for applications that require complex querying and relationships between data. |
| **Complex Queries**            | Supports complex queries with SQL, including joins, subqueries, and window functions, providing more advanced data manipulation and analysis capabilities compared to many NoSQL databases. |
| **Data Integrity & Validation**| Provides strong data validation and constraints (e.g., unique keys, foreign keys), ensuring data is accurate and consistent, whereas NoSQL databases tend to offer less built-in validation. |
| **Standardization**            | SQL is a standardized query language, making PostgreSQL widely compatible with various tools and applications. NoSQL systems often have proprietary query languages, limiting portability. |
| **Transactions Support**       | PostgreSQL has robust support for multi-step transactions, allowing multiple operations to be treated as a single unit of work. Many NoSQL databases lack robust transactional support. |
| **Extensibility**              | PostgreSQL is highly extensible, allowing users to define custom data types, operators, and functions, and even add new indexing methods. |
| **Security**                   | PostgreSQL has advanced security features like role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring fine-grained control over database permissions. While NoSQL databases often have simpler or less granular security features. |
| **Data Integrity Constraints** | Supports advanced constraints like foreign keys, unique keys, and check constraints to enforce data integrity, which is often missing or harder to implement in NoSQL. |
| **Mature Ecosystem**           | PostgreSQL has been around for decades, and has a large, mature ecosystem of tools, libraries, and extensions, providing robust community support. |
| **Handling Structured Data**   | Ideal for structured data that follows a predefined schema, ensuring high performance for relational queries|


PostgreSQL excels in handling structured data, complex relationships, and ensuring consistency, making it a better choice when data integrity and relational operations are key requirements.

## Data Models
🚨**Required**

Based on the technologies and requiremetns used for this project the Database with all its implemented features are stored under [Tech-Roadmap](https://github.com/AlAliMazen/Tech-Roadmap-DRF?tab=readme-ov-file#data-models). In additon to the Datamodels shown in the walkthrough of the Moments project by Code Institute, I have added the following models to enhance my API and the Front-End website. The new models includes: Courses, enrollments, rating and rviews. In total there are 9 models implemented in the backend and represents the API which is published puplically under [Tech-Roadmap-DRF](https://tech-roadmap-drf-6a7361986bbb.herokuapp.com/).

Following is a screen shot about the ERD done by using [dbdiagram.io software](https://dbdiagram.io/d):

- **Explanation**: This feature enhances user experience by providing clear feedback that the page doesn’t exist, redirecting users to the correct paths rather than leaving them in confusion or frustration.

### 10. **Filtering**
- **Feature**: Users can filter both articles and courses to find specific content.
- **Explanation**: Filters provide an efficient way to navigate large amounts of content. Whether a user is searching for a particular course in a specific field or articles on a certain topic, the filtering feature saves time and offers personalized browsing.

### 11. **Write Reviews**
- **Feature**: Logged-in users can write reviews for the courses they are enrolled in.
- **Explanation**: This allows users to give detailed feedback on the course material, the instructor’s teaching style, or any other elements they found useful or lacking. Reviews enrich the course catalog by offering insight from past learners.


## Future Features
🚀 **merit & beyhond**

### Future Features

1. **User Profile Deletion**: In future updates, users will have the ability to delete their own profiles. This action will also remove all associated content, including articles, comments, enrollments, and any other form of participation. Ensuring that all user-generated data is appropriately deleted will maintain database integrity and privacy.

2. **"My Courses" Section**: A dedicated "My Courses" page will be introduced to provide users with a personalized view of the courses they are enrolled in. This feature will offer easy access to ongoing or completed courses, enhancing the learning experience and improving course management for users.

3. **Course Creation for Admins**: Currently, only website administrators can create courses through the admin panel. A future enhancement will involve adding a dedicated course creation page for administrators, streamlining the process and making it easier to manage and publish new courses for visitors and enrolled users.

These future features will expand the platform’s functionality, improve user experience, and provide greater control and customization for both users and administrators.



# Testing (Still to do)
🚨**Required**

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that
the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and
ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to
achieve their goals.


**At this point, you should use gitHub Issues Templates and Test Case** to track test cases and defects. Here's
a [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDS5tZeMO77Dfq85IZGMSV6C41XaPm9FwcpR3k-UTVc/edit#heading=h.3kdbr3tqbzi)
I put together for this process.

You should make sure your test cases cover the following: 


-------------------------



## Cross Browser and Cross Device Testing
🚨**Required**


I prioritize using frameworks that handle much of the complexity of creating responsive websites. For this project, I utilized **React-Bootstrap 4.6** (as recommended by Code Institute), which provides a robust system for ensuring optimal responsiveness across various devices. This framework allowed me to efficiently manage layouts and elements, adapting the site seamlessly to different screen sizes. I have tested the website across multiple devices and platforms to ensure consistency and smooth performance for all users.

| TOOL / Device                 | BROWSER     | SCREEN RESOLUTION  | SCREEN SIZE |
|-------------------------------|-------------|--------------------|-------------|

## Why Choosing the pre-defined Browsers

1. Bases on the information available on [most-popular-websites](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share) I can confirm that the best browser is chrome world-wide and this makes it more efficient to start coding the website based on the tools provided including Networking Tools to check the responsiveness of the website and offering tools like Lighthouse to check for the accessibility.

2. Another browser includes Safari and I like it because it is built in macOS, though it has also no compatible issues when resizing. In the statics on the pre-defined site it comes in the second place and that can be because it comes pre-installed on the system.

## Accessibility Testing
🚨**Required**


**Lighthouse**
It is very important to keep in mind that the Accessibility test doesn't always look as good as the code is. It depends on many factors including the good and clean code. I used Google Chrome Tools to perform the accessibility tests. 

One more point that can effect the Lighthouse results is the source where it runs and the internet connection.

1. Home Page

![acc-home](./README_ASSETS/tech_ACC_1_home.png)

2. Courses Page

10. Add comment to an article

![add-course-review](./README_ASSETS/tech_ACC_8_course_article_review.png)





## Validation Testing
🚨**Required**

You should try to ensure you code is valid and follows proper indentation. In this section you should write up any
websites you used to validate your code so there is credit given to those sites. Then add links to the test cases you
put into GitHub for the validation. You can copy your validation success to those tests.

The following site were used to aid in validation testing:

- **[CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)**

> If you only have one CSS file, you can just run the validator through one deployed page URL, if you have custom CSS for diffent pages, make sure you hit those different URLS

- **[HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)**

> For each view you wrote, you should validate the HTML and have a test case for it linked to from here
> NOTE: You may need to right-click to view the source of each page and paste that into the validator if you need to go through authentication to get to the page.

- **[JS validation](https://jshint.com)**

> for each .js file, copy the code and paste it into this site, and have a test case for it linked to from here. You can have warnings, but no errors.
> if using ES6, add this before pasting in your file: `/*jshint esversion: 6 */ `, similarily you can update it to 7 if you see warnings about ES7 syntax `/*jshint esversion: 7 */ `

- **[CI's pep8 tool](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)** 

> for each .py file you created, copy the source code and paste it into this site, and have a test case for it linked to from here.
> include a screenshot of results in the test case showing NO ERRORS. (you should do this for all .py files in your repo)
> 
> **run.py**
> 
> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23039742/212106175-36b2f18a-7c75-458d-94dd-9886e81c71f3.png)

> Ideally you would have no errors remaining outside of line too long which you can fix by 
> 
> adding
> ```$python 
> # noqa
> ```
> There is a space before the # and after it to skip the quality assurance for that line.
> 
> Note any errors or warnings you are ignoring and why.

- **[JSON validation](https://jsonlint.com/)**

> for each .json file, you should copy the code and paste it into this site, and have a test case for it linked to from here.

## Automated Testing
🚀 **merit & beyhond**

**NOTE: If you want MERIT or Higher, you MUST have some automated testing**
If you managed to write jasmine tests or some django tests, note those files out here and how to run them.

https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ms4_challenger/blob/master/documentation/TESTING.md is my write up about my automated testing and how I ran them, but a simple test I'd recommend is a views test that tests authentication and any views you limit to superusers or logged in users.

https://github.com/maliahavlicek/ms4_challenger/blob/master/challenges/tests/test_views.py

## Defects
🚨**Required**

At this point you really should be using GITHUB's Issues to track these as it helps you with the AGILE process
requirement as it's really easy to copy/paste screenshots in and then write up how you closed them.

[Here's a brief overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDS5tZeMO77Dfq85IZGMSV6C41XaPm9FwcpR3k-UTVc/edit#heading=h.542xzc8ufx4x)
I put together on how to do this.

is what my custom tempalte looks like in the UX

## Defects of Note
🚀 **merit & beyhond**

Some defects are more pesky than others. Highlight 3-5 of the bugs that drove you the most nuts and how you finally
ended up resolving them. Just create a link to the issues/defect of note.

### Outstanding Defects

It's ok to not resolve all the defects you found. If you know of something that isn't quite right, list it out and
explain why you chose not to resolve it. Again, do this in gitHub and provide a link to the defects you are not closing
and ensure they have a comment in them.

## Development Deployment 
🚨**Required** 

This section should describe the process someone would have to go through to get the local working in GitPod, or your preferred IDE. Start from installing the chrome extension then clicking the green gitpod button in THEIR FORKED repository, the enumerate the steps to walk them through the process as if they were brand new to this proccess. **Include screenshots** where applicable.

**Key points to cover** 
- Install required python packages: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Create env.py
- What to put in the env.py, don’t disclose real values
>  - EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - EMAIL_USERNAME=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - CLOUDINARY_URL=<YOUR_VALUE>
>  - DEV=True
- Apply Database Migrations so the database starts up `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a super user so you can add and inspect things via django admin  `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Preload data: Sometimes you might want to include steps to create data in the admin or preload a data dump [coderwall blog](https://coderwall.com/p/mvsoyg/django-dumpdata-and-loaddata) has examples on how to dump data and load it which saves a bunch of time when deploying the application from a local database to a hosted database but you don’t  have to do this step
- Start the server `python3 manage.py runserver`


## Production Deployment
🚨**Required** 

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a server where anyone can access the url without your machine running. This is typically Heroku. **Include screenshots** if you think they would make the process easier. Start with getting an heroku account and then setting up databases and other packages.

If you have project settings required for Heroku, provide a table of the keys and values. Do not share your personal
keys but either cut them out of the screenshot or say <YOUR_VALUE> and include links on how the user would obtain such
values.

**Key points to cover** 
- cerating new app
- setting app name
- setting region
- entering dreaded billing info
- subscribing to a plan
- setting up db
- adding environmental values- have a list or table so user has less chance of typos
>  - EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
>  - DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
>  - EMAIL_USERNAME
>  - SECRET_KEY
>  - CLOUDINARY_URL
>  - COLLECT_STATIC
- adding build packages
- deploy
- gitHub connection
- auto vs manul deploy
- monotior logs


# Credits
🚨**Required**

To avoid plagiarism amd copyright infringement, you should mention any other projects, stackoverflow, videos, blogs, etc that you used to gather imagery or ideas for your code even if you used it as a starting point and modified things. Giving credit to other people's efforts and ideas that saved you time acknowledges the hard work others did.

-[Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template)
    - The Template for the GUI for this project was provided by Code Institute. This allows for the Command line to be shown and used within the browser.

## Content

Use bullet points to list out sites you copied text from and cross-reference where those show up on your site

## Media

Make a list of sites you used images from. If you used several sites try to match up each image to the correct site. This includes attribution for icons if they came from font awesome or other sites, give them credit.

## Acknowledgments

This is the section where you refer to code examples, mentors, blogs, stack overflow answers and videos that helped you accomplish your end project. Even if it's an idea that you updated you should note the site and why it was important to your completed project.

If you used a CodeInstitute Instructional project as a starting point. Make note of that here too.
